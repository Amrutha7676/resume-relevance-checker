    "result": "1. **Relevance Score (0-100)**: 65\n\n2. **Matched Skills**:\n   - Python (Pandas)\n   - Data cleaning\n   - Data exploration (EDA)\n   - Data visualization (Power BI)\n   - Team collaboration\n   - Problem-solving\n   - Experience with Excel\n\n3. **Missing Skills**:\n   - Bachelor's degree in Mechanical/Automotive/Production/Manufacturing engineering (the candidate has a degree in Computer Science)\n   - Experience in a manufacturing company (the candidate's experience is primarily in data analysis and projects)\n   - Understanding of manufacturing data and its relationships\n   - Experience working with machine learning engineers, data scientists, and product managers\n   - Specific mention of R (the candidate does not list R as a skill)\n\n4. **Short Summary**:\n   The candidate has a solid foundation in data analysis with experience in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Power BI. They have completed relevant projects involving data exploration and cleaning, which aligns with some of the responsibilities outlined in the job description. However, the candidate lacks a degree in the specified engineering fields and experience in a manufacturing environment, which are critical for the role at Axion Ray. Additionally, the candidate's experience does not explicitly include collaboration with machine learning engineers or data scientists, which is a key aspect of the job. Overall, while there are relevant skills, the candidate does not fully meet the qualifications required for the position."
